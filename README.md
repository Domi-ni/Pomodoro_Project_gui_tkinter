<p align="justify"> 
  This project is a version of a pomodoro timer, which uses a time distribution technique to help reduce anxiety and increase focus and concentration on tasks, avoiding wasted time and distractions.
  The pomodoro technique consists of 4 cycles of 25 minutes of concentration and a 5-minute rest break. After completing 4 cycles, it is recommended to take a long break of 15 minutes and return for another 4 cycles.
